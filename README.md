# HadamardTorsion
Python script to produce simplicial complexes with huge torsion

Run the program in Python to obtain the facets of a simplicial complex with n vertices and 2^(n log n) torsion in first homology.
More information can be found in the paper Hadamard Matrix Torsion written by Davide Lofano and Frank H. Lutz at https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13052

Facets list for the examples HMT(n) with n=4,8,16,32 can be found in the corresponding text file.
